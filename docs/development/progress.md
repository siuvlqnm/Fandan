## LES-84 - Better Auth Login And Default Workspace

Status: implemented.

Commit: see Git history entry `Implement auth workspace flow`.

What changed:

- Added protected creator workspace route `/app`.
- Added `/logout`.
- Login and registration now redirect to `/app` by default and honor a safe `?next=/path` value.
- Successful sign in/sign up creates a default `spaces` row when the user does not have one.
- `requireUserSpace(event)` now guarantees an authenticated user has a current workspace.
- Root layout exposes authenticated navigation and logout.

Verification checklist:

- `npm run check`
- `npm run build`
- Logged-out `/app` returns a redirect to `/login?next=%2Fapp`.
- `/api/health` remains public.
- `/api/me` returns unified 401 while logged out.

Notes for next threads:

- Current auth mode is email + password. Better Auth's `email-otp` and `magic-link` plugins exist in the installed package, but email delivery is not configured yet.
- Creator-side feature work should start from `/app` and use `space.id` for every business query.
- Future `/share/**` pages should remain public and resolve by `share_links.token`.
